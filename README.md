## Problem B Dinosaurs versus Mammals

The largest dinosaurs that walked the earth were approximately an order of magnitude (a factor of ten) 
more massive than the largest land mammals.  It has been hypothesized that this may have been due to factors such as, 
but not limited to, the different levels of oxygen in the atmosphere, the difference in the effort required for giving 
birth to live young versus laying eggs, differences in metabolic rates, differences in the availability of food sources, 
or differences in ambient temperature.  Develop a model to account for the differences in mass between the largest dinosaurs 
and the largest land mammals, and evaluate the effectiveness of this model using biological/paleontological data.

## Abstract

As suggested by recent publications on vertebrate’s maximal size [1], we have worked
on a mathematical model based on resources and energy considerations that can be applied
in order to account for the differences in mass between dinosaurs and mammals
and that permits to reinforce or discard hypothesis about dinosaur’s resources and
biological nature. In this paper we analyze the model, apply it with real biological/-
paleontological data and use it to give explanations to the maximal body size for land
mammals and dinosaurs. Furthermore, other implications of the model are explored in
order to give answers to other important questions about dinosaur’s nature. In particular,
we have found that dinosaurs having similar characteristics to varanids in terms
of energy expenditure when extrapolated to larger mass successfully explains observed
mass ratios of one order of magnitude between dinosaurs and mammals.
